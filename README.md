# Status-Tracker-for-Leads
The "Status Tracker" function automates the process of checking and updating lead statuses in a Google Sheets document named "Leads Data". It iterates through each row, extracting the email address from the second column, and queries the AIESEC database via GraphQL to retrieve the current status of each email. If the email exists in the database, it updates the first column of the corresponding row with the retrieved status; otherwise, it marks it as "Lead | Wrong mail". The function logs the email and its status for each processed row, providing transparency into the status retrieval process.
